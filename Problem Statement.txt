---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob wants to build a Docker image for a NodeJS application, and needs help to complete the task.

1. The project directory contains the package.json, server.js, and Dockerfile files. You need to:
a) Complete the server.js file and display the message "You have successfully built a docker image for NodeJS application".
b) Complete the Dockerfile file and expose it on port 8000.
2. Integrate the Docker application with Jenkins running on port 8080, and create a job JenkinsDockerDemo. 
3. Build a Docker image myimage with tag tag1, and run the image on port 8000 in a detached mode.
4. Successful completion can be verified on port 8000.

Bob can verify successful completion of running of the image.
